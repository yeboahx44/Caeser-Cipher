# Caeser-Cipher Application
This Python program implements a Caesar Cipher with a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library. 
It allows users to either encode or decode a message by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a specified amount. 
Non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) are preserved in the original form, meaning they are not modified by the cipher. 
You can choose to encode or decode a message by specifying the shift value.

## Features:
- **Encode/Decode** messages with a specified shift value.
- **Graphical User Interface** for easy usage.


## Installation:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Python and the `tkinter` library (usually pre-installed with Python).
3. Run the app:

   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
